Sploit2 was very similar to the first sploit except that you could only overwrite a single bit of the program's ebp register.  However this means that we could change ebp to be anywhere from bffffd00 to bffffdff.  We changed the last bit so ebp became bffffd30 which is an address inside our buffer.  When the program moves inside our buffer it finds the shellcode and gives the user root access.
