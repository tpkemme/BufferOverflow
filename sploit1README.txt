For sploit1, we started by analyzing the program using GDB and finding that the location of the buffer is at 0xbffffd6d.  We then create a character array that is longer that the buffer so when target performs strcopy, the program's ebp and eip are overwritten.  The eip is overwritten with 0xbffffd6d so that program goes to that address after performing strcopy.  After the program gets through our NOP section, it comes across the shellcode, thus giving a user root access.
